"""
motion model of trajectory, notice that objects of different categories often exhibit various motion patterns.
Five implemented motion models, including
- Two linear model: Constant Acceleration(CA), Constant Velocity(CV)
- Three non-linear model: Constant Turn Rate and Acceleration(CTRA), Constant Turn Rate and Velocity(CTRV), Bicycle Model
Two core functions for each model: state predict and state update
